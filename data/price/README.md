This folder is for storing the original price data.     
The data should be better in the following format :     
%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,open,high,low,close,volume,open_interest        
in file name like symbol_name.csv.      

The AAPL is a template data just for demo use, it might not 100% correct to     
the market you watch.

It could be in other format, while the interface of processing data is implemeted 
in the ways you need.
